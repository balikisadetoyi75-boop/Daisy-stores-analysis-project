# **SQL BUSINESS ANALYSIS PROJECT**

## **BUSINESS SQL ANALYSIS PROJECT FOR DAISY STORES AND ENTERPRISE**



## **Project Overview**

Daisy Stores is experiencing rapid growth, but the owner lacks visibility into which products and categories are truly driving revenue.  
This SQL analysis project explores the company’s sales data to uncover performance trends, identify top‑earning categories, and highlight underperformers that may require attention.  
The goal is to deliver clear, data‑driven insights that support decisions around marketing spend and inventory planning.



## **STAKEHOLDER REQUEST**

'We’ve been growing fast, but I’m concerned we don’t actually know which products are driving our revenue.  
I need you to analyse our sales data and tell me which product categories are performing the best.  
Specifically, I want to know:

* The total revenue generated by each product category over the last 3 months
* Which category is our top performer
* Whether any category is underperforming compared to the overall average  
  Give me insights I can use to decide where to focus our marketing and inventory budget'.

## **BUSINESS QUESTIONS**

* WHAT IS THE TOTAL REVENUE GENERATED BY EACH PRODUCT IN THE LAST THREE MONTHS?
* WHICH CATEGORY IS THE TOP PERFOMER?
* WHICH CATEGORY IS THE UNDERPERFORMER COMPARED TO OVERALL AVERAGE?



## **SQL Techniques Used**

This project demonstrates:

* INNER JOINs across multiple tables
* Aggregations: SUM, COUNT, AVG
* Date filtering using DATEADD()
* Subqueries for statistical comparisons
* GROUP BY and HAVING clauses
* Ranking using ORDER BY and TOP



## **Results And Insights**

The analysis revealed the following key performance patterns:

* Electronics is the overall highest earning category.  
  It generated the largest share of the total revenue and is the top performer across all categories.
* Beauty products generated the highest single product revenue within the last three months, which indicates a recent high demand of beauty products.
* Clothing is the primary underperforming category, with revenue below average category revenue.



## **Recommendations**

* Channel more investments into electronics as it is the strongest revenue generating category and performs consistently well.
* Support the growing demand for Beauty products by ensuring adequate stock levels and engage in promotional activities.
* Review the Clothing category strategy as it the weakest category.  
  Engage more in visibility to boost sales to an equal level on all categories.
